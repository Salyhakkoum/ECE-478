
Genetic Algorithm Overview

goal: use genetic algorthm and the Chameleon light controller to evolve a lightshow.

how:
	the chamelon accepts a 3.5mm audio input, which it then separates into 5 frequeny bands.
	we can use pyaudio to play a specific frequency for a duration of time

Things we need to know:
	what frequency range corresponds to which band?

Thigns that need to be done
	- come up with evaluation system (fitness function)?
		- evaluate by human
	- how to do crossover?
	- save/load to avoid having to restart
		-should have a counter to say what generation it is
	
general flow	
	- program prepares a gene
		-load breeding pool
	- program uses gene to produce 2 lightshow genes
	-show both lightshows
		-array of frequency
		- array of length
			for(i, i<steps,++i) {
				play freq (step[i], length[i])
			}
		length can be 0!
	-ask user which was better
	-add better one to breeding pool
	- preform evolution
		-change starting point in sequence/ length
		-alter sequence
			- mutation
			- crossover
		- alter lengths
			- 1 sec max length
	- repeat
